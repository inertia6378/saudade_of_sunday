      Python is a powerful programming language that prioritises readability and ease of use over speed and comile time.
      Many advancements have been made to mitigate the speed and compile issue, but the overall tenants of python
      dictate that saving development time is a higher priority than most other factors. The Python community is a very
      large and open one, fully willing to share their code.

      Python like all OOP languages has built in types. Lists and Dictionaries are build in data structures in Python.
      this gives python the ability to use them without importing utility libraries. Tuples are similat to lists, but
      the items within them are immutable.

    <h2>Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
    <p>
      These notebooks are used primarily by data scientists but can be a valuable tool for learning and teaching python
      to new developers. It allows you to run segments of code and see the out put within simple blocks. These blocks
      can also hold markdown which will be read as simple text or markdown for keeping notes.
